# schematool

The MARC-HI schema tool is a general purpose tool for working with XML Schemas. This tool aims to take most of the hassle out of working with XML schemas. 

The schema tool provides these utilities:

* An XML Schema Viewer which outlines the structure of data
* An XML Schema Differencing tool which illustrates changes in schema structures
* An XPath building tool (in the Schema Viewer). This tool allows developers to quickly build Xpaths based on schema structures
* An XML Schema Copy tool which copies all dependent schemas.
