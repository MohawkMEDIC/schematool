	<body>
	    <h1>User Interface</h1>
	    <p>Schema Tool's interface provides lots of flexibility. Users of Microsoft Visual Studio will find the interface very familiar. Illustrated below is the 
	    main window of Schema Tool when launched:</p>
	    <img src="ss1.png" />
	    <ol>
	        <li><b>Work Area</b> - This is the tool's main work area</li>
	        <li><b>Status Area</b> - Check here to see what the tool is doing</li>
	        <li><b>Tool Menu</b> - This menu contains the tools used with Schema Tool</li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>The utilities that Schema Tool provides are:</p>
	    <table>
	        <tr>
	            <td><img src="Comparison.png" /></td>
	            <td>Compare</td>
	            <td>Compares two schemas and illustrates the structural changes to root elements</td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><img src="xsdOpen.png" /></td>
	            <td>View Schema</td>
	            <td>Opens a schema and illustrates the structures (starting with the root elements) the schema contains</td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><img src="SchemaCopy.png" /></td>
	            <td>Schema Copy</td>
	            <td>Copies a schema and all dependencies. For example, if you copy schema a.xsd and it depends on b.xsd and c.xsd then those schemas are also copied</td>
	        </tr>
	    </table>
	    <h2>The Work Area</h2>
	    <p>The work area is very flexible. Utility windows can be split, moved and docked in any manner that you wish. To move a tool window, simply select the title and drag your mouse, any valid
	    drop area will be hilighted. The figure below shows how this feature can be useful:</p>
	    <p>If there are too many open windows, you can select an active window using the window list tool:</p>
	    <img src="ss2.png" />
	    <p>You may also rearrange the tool windows to better suit your taste:</p>
	    <img src="ss3.png" />
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <tr>
                <td align="center"><img src="install-logo-small.bmp" /></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="footer">Copyright (C) 2010, Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
	</body>
