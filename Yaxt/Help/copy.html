	<h1>Xml Schema Copy</h1>
	<p>The schema copy tool will copy selected and all dependent schemas to a specified directory. The schema copy tool window is outlined in the following image:</p>
	<img src="ss7.png" />
	<ol>
	    <li><b>Source Schema(s)</b> - Click the ellipsis to select schema(s) that you would like copied (holding SHIFT while click files will select multiples)</li>
	    <li><b>Destination Directory</b> - Select the directory that you would like your schema file(s) copied to (note: an empty directory is preferred as it will less likely result in overwritten files)</li>
	    <li><b>Progress / Status</b> - The file currently being copied/processed will be shown here </li>
	    <li><b>Copy</b> - Self explainatory... Starts the copy process.</li>
